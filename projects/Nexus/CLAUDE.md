# Project: Nexus

> "The missing layer between your projects and your AI."
> Right-size intelligence — surface what matters, compress everything else.

A secure, local-first intelligence layer that observes, learns, and coordinates across all Claude Code sessions. Cross-project knowledge graph — never leaves your machine.

## Stack

- **Core/CLI/MCP**: TypeScript, Node.js 20+, pnpm workspaces
- **Database**: SQLite via `better-sqlite3` + SQLCipher (encryption required)
- **CLI**: Commander.js
- **MCP Server**: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
- **Dashboard** (Phase 5): React 18 + Vite + Hono server
- **Desktop app** (Phase 6): Tauri v2 wrapper (Rust + native shell)

## Architecture

```
packages/
  core/       — Shared types, DB layer, orchestrator engine
  cli/        — nexus init/project/sync commands
  mcp/        — MCP server exposing nexus_* tools to Claude Code
  dashboard/  — React/Vite frontend + Tauri desktop shell (Phase 6)
```

In Phase 6, Tauri wraps the existing React dashboard: Tauri spawns the Hono server as a child process, then loads it in a native WebView window.

## Commands

- `pnpm build` — Build all packages
- `pnpm test` — Run all tests
- `pnpm test:unit` — Unit tests only
- `pnpm test:integration` — Integration tests
- `pnpm lint` — ESLint + Prettier check
- `pnpm -r dev` — Dev mode for all packages
- `cd packages/cli && node dist/index.js` — Run CLI locally

## Verification

After changes: `pnpm build && pnpm test`

## Critical Architecture Rules

### Security-first (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Database MUST use SQLCipher encryption — never plain SQLite
- Secret filter is conservative: false positives are BETTER than missing secrets
- No cloud dependencies in packages/core, packages/cli, packages/mcp
- Never log file contents, only paths — session transcripts may contain secrets
- Audit log every mutation operation with timestamp + source

### Token Budget (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- CLAUDE.md Nexus section: hard cap **1,500 tokens** (6,000 chars) — enforced in `generateSection()`
- Structure: Portfolio map → Own-project notes → Decisions → Active conflicts → Behavioral rule
- Portfolio map: one line per project, description ≤ 80 chars from "Project Overview" note
- Decisions: 5 max injected, each summary ≤ 80 chars
- Own-project notes: 150 chars (excludes "Project Overview" — already in portfolio map)
- Behavioral rule: teaches Claude to run `nexus_query` before cross-project decisions
- Principle: CLAUDE.md = headlines. Full detail lives in the DB. Use `nexus query` to surface it.

### MCP Tool Naming
All MCP tools use the `nexus_` prefix: `nexus_query`, `nexus_decide`, `nexus_pattern`, `nexus_check_conflicts`, `nexus_dependencies`, `nexus_preferences`, `nexus_note`
Note: `nexus_pattern` has `action: "search" | "record"` (consolidated from former `nexus_record_pattern`)

### Package Boundaries
- `packages/core` has ZERO CLI/MCP-specific code — it is the pure logic layer
- `packages/cli` and `packages/mcp` import from `packages/core`, never each other
- Dashboard (packages/dashboard) talks to core via Tauri commands, NOT direct import

### SQLCipher Pattern
```typescript
// CORRECT
import Database from 'better-sqlite3';
const db = new Database(dbPath, { /* ... */ });
db.pragma(`key="${encryptionKey}"`);

// WRONG - never open unencrypted
const db = new Database(dbPath);
```

## Task Approach

1. **Ask before implementing cross-package changes** — moving logic between packages is architectural
2. **Phase discipline** — check the current phase before building ahead (see docs/phases.md)
3. **Always run secret filter before logging** — call `filterSecrets(content)` before any write to DB or logs
4. **MCP tools are the external API** — treat them like public API surface, be conservative with changes
5. **Test integration points** — MCP server ↔ core ↔ DB must have integration tests

## Active Knowledge Recording

Call `nexus_note` (action=set) **proactively during sessions** when you encounter:
- **Project identity**: what the project is, who it's for, what problem it solves
- **Key entities**: characters, systems, APIs, or concepts central to this project
- **Cross-project relationships**: how this project connects to other registered projects
- **Domain context**: anything future sessions should load to be immediately productive

Use descriptive titles: `"Project Overview"`, `"Key Entities"`, `"[Feature] Architecture"`.

Notes are persisted to the DB and synced into CLAUDE.md at the next `nexus sync` or Stop hook — every future session on this project (and related child/sibling projects) loads them automatically.

```
# Example — write this when you first understand what a project does:
nexus_note action=set title="Project Overview" content="Nexus is a local-first..."
```

Notes are **not a log** — they're living documents. Update an existing note by calling `set` with the same title.

## Common Mistakes

- **Opening DB without encryption**: Always set `key` pragma immediately after opening
- **Logging session content**: Only log file paths and metadata, never transcript content
- **Skipping secret filter**: Run `filterSecrets()` before any content hits the DB
- **Cross-package imports**: Never import CLI code in MCP package or vice versa
- **Hard-coding project paths**: All paths go through the project registry in core

## Compact Instructions

When compacting, preserve:
- Current phase (1–6) and active task
- Any DB schema decisions made this session
- MCP tool signatures agreed upon
- Secret filter regex patterns added

### Recorded Decisions
- **[security]** Use encrypted SQLite database (nexus.db, 5MB) for persisting project decisions …
  > Database is encrypted and stored in user's home directory (.nexus), with MCP server managing access through registered tools rather than direct file exposure.
- **[security]** Maintain permission allowlists for MCP tools in Claude settings alongside globa…
  > Separate registration (which servers are available) from authorization (which tools can be used) provides defense-in-depth and allows fine-grained access control.
- **[security]** Store Nexus database encrypted at user home directory (~/.nexus/nexus.db)
  > Centralizes developer intelligence in one secure location per user, isolated from project repos
- **[security]** Add database-level CHECK constraints on tier and severity enum columns
  > Enforce valid values at storage layer to prevent invalid state propagation
- **[security]** Add dismissal tracking via `dismissAdvisory(db, id, source)` setting resolved_a…
  > Allows users to dismiss non-actionable advisories while preserving dismissal history (source/timestamp) for debugging false positive patterns and improving LLM prompt calibration.

> **Cross-project rule**: Before making decisions that affect shared concerns (APIs, auth, data formats, deployment) or asking the user for server/SSH/infrastructure details, run `nexus_query` to check for existing decisions, notes, and conflicts across the portfolio.
> When the user says "save to nexus" or you learn something worth preserving across sessions (project identity, key entities, architecture decisions, cross-project relationships), call `nexus_note` with `action: "set"` and a descriptive `title`.
